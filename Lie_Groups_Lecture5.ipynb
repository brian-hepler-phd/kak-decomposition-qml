    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variational Approach:**  \n",
    "  By parameterizing a circuit that mimics the KAK form, we used gradient descent to optimize the circuit so that its unitary $U_{\\text{learned}}$ approximates our target $U_{\\text{target}}$. The loss function was defined via a fidelity measure that is insensitive to global phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison:**  \n",
    "  The closed-form KAK decomposition, when computed exactly, should reproduce the target unitary exactly (fidelity 1 up to numerical error). In our variational method, if the optimization converges well the final fidelity should be very close to 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**  \n",
    "  This gradient-based (variational) method is fully differentiable and can be integrated into larger quantum machine learning pipelines. It also has the potential to “learn” decompositions when analytical methods are intractable or when one wants to optimize over additional cost functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:**  \n",
    "  The optimization is iterative and may require careful tuning of hyperparameters (like the learning rate and the number of steps) and might get stuck in local minima. In contrast, a closed-form method computes the parameters directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this example demonstrates that with Pennylane’s QML libraries you can trade an analytical procedure for a differentiable, optimization‑based approach that fits naturally into variational quantum algorithms."
